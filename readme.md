Copy (called sync) your page on when saving the page in the panel, from a domain (called hub) > to other domains (called nodes).

```text
hub (domain)
├─ node (domain)
└─ node (domain)
```

## Simple setup

### 1. Install the plugin

[Install the plugin](docs/installation.md) on both the hub and the nodes.

### 2. Add domains

In the hub `config.php`, add node domains and page parents that should be synced to the nodes.

**Example**

```php
c::set('plugin.sync.domains', [
    'https://example.com' => [
        'projects/project-a',
    ],
    'https://anotherdomain.com' => [
        'projects'
    ]
]);
```

### 3. Add a token on both hub and nodes

A token is **required**. Use the same string on both the hub and the nodes.

```php
c::set('plugin.sync.token', null);
```

There are much more options for the [hub and nodes](docs/hub-nodes.md) and for [nodes](docs/node.md).

## Usage

1. Login to the hub domain panel and create/update a page.
1. Login to the node domain to see if the change has been synced.
